    abstract = { Electrical field measurement can be used to map the conductive fluid injected into the earth during hydraulic fracturing production. For deep reservoirs, this can be achieved by directly connecting the electric source to the steel cased wells. While the well depth of stimulated fractures is easily known, the fluid flow perpendicular to the well path is often a question. In this study, we examine the feasibility of monitoring the directional flow of the injected conductive fluid from the surface by utilizing the existing oilfield infrastructure, particularly the steel well casings. Using a realistic earth model, we show that multiple parallel wells can amplify signals from the fluid migration, and the surface data are most sensitive to the horizontal flows. The vertical movement of the fluid can only be detected when the strata above and below the target layer are of different resistivities. Our results serve as a reference for the instrument and survey design of electrical fracturing monitoring. }

    abstract = "{Steel-cased wells used as long electrodes (LEs) in a surface-electric or electromagnetic survey can enhance anomalous signals from deep hydraulic fracturing zones filled by injected fluid. Although recent research has been published on the algorithms designed for the simulation of the effect of casings, feasibility studies on resolving the small-scale fracturing fluid flow from surface data are lacking. We have carried out a detectability and recoverability study for a top-casing electric source configuration. Applying a fast 3D DC modeling code using the concept of the equivalent resistor network, the detectability study shows that favorable conditions for detecting the fluid flow direction include multiple electrically coupled wells and different electric conductivities above and below the shale layer. The observed behavior is then modeled through a circuit analog. For the purpose of fracturing fluid imaging, the model for recovery is simplified as a distribution of full fluid saturation on a 2D fracture plane. A deep-learning (DL) framework is adopted to solve the imaging problem, which is difficult for conventional regularized inversions. Our DL implementation uses a supervised deep fully convolutional network to learn the relationship between data patterns on the surface and the model of fracturing fluid distribution, encoded in a large number of synthetic data-model pairs. Once trained, the neural network can make a real-time and pixel-wise prediction of the fluid distribution. The robustness of our DL approach is tested in the presence of ambient noise and inaccuracies in casing conductivity. A reasonably consistent prediction performance has been observed. Our numerical feasibility study results demonstrate that electric surveys using steel casings as LEs have great potentials in real-time monitoring of fracturing fluid flow.}",

    abstract = { It is critical to ensure wellbore integrity in oil and gas fields for the purpose of reducing the risks associated with fluids leakage in resource extraction, environmental damage, and waste disposal. By energizing the wellhead and using steelcased wells as long electrodes (LE), electrical methods show the obvious ability to enhance the sensitivity of surface data to the deep anomaly. The conductivity value of steel casing is very high, which is usually reasonably assumed, but in practice may not be correct. Moreover, the damaged part of the casing can be equivalent to locally reduced conductivity in the conductivity distribution of the entire casing. Therefore, in this work, we introduce deep learning (DL) technique in the form of a fully convolutional network (FCN) to reconstruct 1D integrated conductivity distribution along a well casing. A number of synthetic data sets are generated by a fast 3D dc forward modeling algorithm using an equivalent resistor network (RESnet) where the casing is treated as a line-like object with a variable cross-sectional area integrated conductivity. We collect surface timedifferential electric field data on a survey line across the wellhead as the input for our neural network. After the training phase, the neural network can transform new sets of surface data to 1D casing conductivity models, which reflects the damage or corrosion along the well. Our synthetic results show the promising potential of combining surfaced LE electrical methods and DL as a non-invasive technology in the on-site evaluation and real-time monitoring of casing integrity conditions. This data-driven inversion can also be used as a tool to recover the casing conductivity, which has not been studied as a geophysical inversion target.Presentation Date: Wednesday, October 14, 2020Session Start Time: 9:20 AMPresentation Time: 11:25 AMLocation: Poster Station 7Presentation Type: Poster }

    abstract = { The integrity of steel well casings is often inspected by downhole probes that are inconvenient and interruptive. We propose an approach to continuously monitor the corrosion and damage of well casings using only inexpensive electrical field data on the surface. The method connects electrical source to the top of steel casings, and the integrity of the casings, reflected as conductivity deviation from the original value, can influence the current channeling effect along the casing and therefore be manifested in the variation of electrical field on the surface. Our numerical examples show that surface electrical data are sensitive to the variation in the depth, length and severity of damage along casings, even for relatively complex earth structure and horizontal wells. In order to provide real-time assessment of the status of steel casings, we adopt a deep learning approach to image the conductivity along a casing. Our approach trains a fully convolutional network with thousands of random samples from synthetic modeling. Once trained, the network is capable of providing a piece wise prediction of conductivity along the casing if given electrical datasets that have not be seen before. Our feasibility studies demonstrate that the combination of top-casing-source and deep learning is a promising approach in the monitoring of well integrity. }

    abstract = { The electromagnetic method has a proven physical basis and advantages in subsurface fluid detection. The result of fracturing operation can be evaluated by monitoring the electromagnetic anomalies from low-resistivity fracturing fluid before and after the fracturing and inferring the range of fracturing fluid distribution. However, the traditional electromagnetic 3D inversion is time-consuming and cannot meet the requirement of real-time imaging during fracturing. In this paper, we use an improved supervised deep fully convolutional network (FCN) to learn the relationship between surface electromagnetic data patterns and the underground fracturing fluid distribution models. The relationship is encoded in many synthetic “data-model” pairs obtained through 3D forward modeling. By completing the forward modeling and neural network training on the computer cluster in advance, we successfully carried out a field experiment of 3D real-time imaging of fracturing fluid. }

    abstract = { Highly conductive steel cased wells have been proposed to be used as long electrodes in the electrical survey for hydraulic fracturing monitoring. Recent advancements have enabled accurate 3D numerical modeling of complex well casings, but few have investigated the feasibility of imaging the fracturing fluid using the electrical method. In this work, we develop an interactive inversion scheme powered by a fast forward modeling algorithm using an equivalent resistor network (RESnet). Our inversion fits anomalies in time-lapse differential data, so biases caused by inaccuracy in the background model can be cancelled out. The fluid model is parameterized as a polygon of full saturation on the fracture plane and a thickness-integrated conductivity of the fluid sheet. Surface electrical field data are mapped to the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space to aid visual inspection and model adjustment by hand. In our blind test with the presence of three horizontal wells, the computing time of one trial model was about 8 s and the geometry and conductivity of an asymmetric fluid slab was imaged after 30 trials; the entire inversion is completed within 20 minutes including both human and computer time on a desktop PC. Our results show the feasibility of electrical method in high-resolution fracturing fluid monitoring, as well as the practicality of interactive inversion in real-time imaging.Presentation Date: Tuesday, September 17, 2019Session Start Time: 8:30 AMPresentation Time: 8:55 AMLocation: 225CPresentation Type: Oral }
